                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a fresh graduate from Bicol University with strong technical skills in computer systems, troubleshooting, and maintenance. I have hands-on experience in diagnosing hardware and software issues, maintaining system performance, and handling IT-related clerical tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the development side, I work with front-end technologies such as <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to build clean and functional website interfaces. I also have experience using <strong>C and C++</strong> for Arduino-based projects and other embedded systems that require hardware–software integration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am committed to continuously learning and improving my skills in both software and hardware fields. I adapt quickly, work well with teams, and always give my best effort to complete tasks efficiently and professionally. My goal is to contribute positively to any organization by combining my technical knowledge, problem-solving mindset, and willingness to grow in the IT industry.
                </p>
